## TokTik
A very basic TikTok like application for iOS that streams random videos from https://livestreamfails.com

## Motivation
This project was developed as a code asignment.


## Notes
I've focused my time in the logic of the app since adding more complexity to the UI to mimic some of the features TikTok have (like social media badges, share button, name of the song, or even a chat, etc...). This features would also look better with real data (from an API), and since there is none, I've spent my time elsewhere. If you would like to see more of the UI implemented (or anything at all), please do let me know

I've also noticed that every now and then the links for the videos are broken, the ones I've checked didn't have to do with the logic of the app but I could be missing something, after all this is a day project and I'm not sure how much time should I spend. 

I have not used any html parser for Swift (even though there are plenty out there in Github) as it was very easy to grab the video link from the html source

Overall the code is commented and (hopefully)  easy to understand.

Q: What minimum version of Android / iOS app should support?
The minimun deployment version for this project is iOS 11. If I was interviewing candidates I would like to see how they deal with new technologies & versions, and be able to show that your knowledge is up to date, rather than dealing with version conflicts and solving compatibility issues. After all, the older the version, the better documented it is...

So this is pretty much as far as 8 hours took me (maybe a bit more, I did not pay too much attention but anyway this is the minimun product I'd like to present). 

If I had more time to spend on this, I'd probably use it on:
 - UI and Video to video transitions
 - Do research on how to improve performance
 - Check that the overall app flow works and that there are no crashing scenarios
